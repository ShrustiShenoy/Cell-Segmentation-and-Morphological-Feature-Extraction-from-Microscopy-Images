# Cell-Segmentation-and-Morphological-Feature-Extraction-from-Microscopy-Images
This project focuses on single-cell image analysis using classical computer vision techniques to extract quantitative features from microscopy data. The pipeline performs cell segmentation, morphological measurement, and visualization. This is foundational for downstream biological insights such as cell cycle analysis, morphological phenotyping, or linking morphology to omics features.

# Objectives
Segment individual cells from microscopy images

Extract quantitative features (area, perimeter, circularity)

Visualize annotated cells

Generate feature tables for downstream statistical or ML analyses

# Requirements
pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib pandas

# How to Run
python3 process_cell_advanced.py
